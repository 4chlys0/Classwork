***Firewalls (Bash, 2015)***

Some intro firewall exercises (iptables)

***Hash Collision (Python, 2018)***

Simple MD5 Collision

Two files, 1 and 2, with a different inserted blob generated with a collision tool. Running MD5sum will yield the same hash but SHAsum will yield 2 different hashes. Executing the python files will yield 2 different messages.

This is why MD5 should not be used as a hashing algorithm to ensure integrity (though it still is frequently in Digital Forensics)
